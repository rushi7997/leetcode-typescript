# Leetcode Solution Using TypeScript

this is my solution for leetcode problems using typescript and nodejs.

to run the solution, you need to install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node).

change the file src/index.ts and run command `npx ts-node src/index.ts` to run the code for the solutions.

all the solutions are written in typescript and are written in the src/solutions folder.

I have also written the test cases for each problem that I have solved.

to run the test cases install dependencies and run command `npm install` and then run command `npm test`.
